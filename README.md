## Overview

A simple JavaScript doodle, using [p5js](https://p5js.org/), of backing lights I saw during a live music concert. I found the pattern interesting enough that I recreated them here as an homage. This is also an example of how to code fading lamps within a repeating frame-based state machine.

Watch it with some 4-4 music, adjusting the playback speed as necessary using the value passed to `frameRate()` in `setup()`, and enjoy.

## Try it live

* Play a recent version of the code [here](https://editor.p5js.org/diodesign/full/wn_tFXMMS) in your browser.
* Tweak and play a recent version of the code [here](https://editor.p5js.org/diodesign/sketches/wn_tFXMMS) in your browser.

## Future work

* Provide a UI element for adjusting the animation speed to the user's currently playing music.
* Access the currently playing music and automatically adjust animation speed to the BPM of the audio.
